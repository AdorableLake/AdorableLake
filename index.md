## Welcome to My GitHub Pages!!!

You can call me as "Lake". Next is my shot self-intro.
I'm coming to finish my undergraduate-life in China right now. My major in this stage is not connected with program at all!
Guess what? I'm a design-major student! Haha!
But I try to change my major to something like programming! Just like what I said in my first page in Github:

```makedown
"Programming is the coolest thing in this plant!"
```
